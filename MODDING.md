# Modding Feed Snivy

Want to add characters or modify existing ones or mod Feed Snivy in general or otherwise want to know how the game works? Here's how.

# Animation Format

Feed Snivy uses a semi-proprietary format called ".anm2" for tweened character animations, sourced from a spritesheet. This file format comes from the game _The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth_ (a game I mod on my own time) for animations. 

You can either use my own animation editor for that game and this one (recommended), [Anm2Ed](https://github.com/ShweetsStuff/anm2ed), or if you have that game on Steam, you can find that game's own proprietary animation editor in that game's Steam folder and then in tools/IsaacAnimationEditor. I can't guarantee the stability or perfect efficacy of either, but Anm2Ed has crash mitigations and autosave (but of course, save often, for whatever you do).

Anm2Ed has slightly more extensions to the base format; in particular, something called "Regions", which allows you to set spritesheet regions (areas in the spritesheet that can be repurposed) to quickly reference in animations; previously, one would have to manually create a perfectly spaced spritesheet and then manually set values; this is no longer the case, so using "Regions" is recommended. For the leanest files, in Anm2Ed, go to Settings -> Configure -> File -> Compatibility, and set it to "Anm2Ed Limited".

My process for making characters is that they're typically comprised of many "cells" (small graphics). I make these cells their own file, and then in the editor, I drag them onto "Spritesheets" and then right click -> merge them, with the "Make Spritesheet Regions" option enabled. Then, right click -> Pack on a spritesheet to optimize it all nice for one big spritesheet atlas with everything in one place. It won't produce a very comprehensible spritesheet, but it works just fine (not my problem). Make sure to save the spritesheets you're using once you're done. You can sort regions around by clicking, holding and moving them around.

If you'd like a quick primer on how to use either program, check either of [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU_GMo2l7NY) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiXVM6Gwzlw) out. Much of the information is interchangeable between the programs, though both are a little out of date on their current version.

For each "stage" of the character (graphical change), an animation equivalent will be expected. Stages are zero-indexed in this context; so the first stage would be 0. If you have an idle animation and want that for the first, starting stage, you'd need to name the animation "Idle0", for example, and then reference that in character.xml (more on that later). Don't manually input the number for the animation in any file, just put in the first part, "Idle"; the game will handle which stage-animation plays when.

Know that despite Anm2Ed supporting sounds for animations, don't expect these to work in context based on names; use the .xml sound attributes when applicable. You can add sounds for fluff, though.

# Resources

There's two folders inside resources; "characters" and "font".

"font" is just a font containing the font used in the selection screen. That's literally it. This technically isn't needed; Dear ImGui has its own font that will be used if this font is missing.

EVERYTHING ELSE is stored inside bespoke character archives (.zips) in the "characters" folder. This has all data associated with characters. Think of characters more as tailored game experiences rather than literally being just the characters. Not only is there the character graphics, but backgrounds, items, parameters, etc. These are intensely customizable to suit whatever experience you'd like (within the confines of the engine, of course).

Feed Snivy uses a collection of [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) files to parse data; make sure to brush up on the format. The engine can expect six files in the archive's root: 

- areas.xml
- character.xml
- cursor.xml
- dialogue.xml
- items.xml
- menu.xml
- play.xml

(dialogue.xml may or may not be optional; but in future updates I'll make sure of it, for dialogueless characters).

If you're making your own character, your best bet would probably be just to copy the Snivy character and edit it based on your needs, just as a helpful start.

# Character

## areas.xml
"Areas" refers to the backgrounds of the game. I'd planned for the game to dynamically switch areas based on stage (in case you want a character to become a blob that grows bigger than a city or whatever) but this isn't implemented. I'd just have one entry in here for the game's background.

### Areas
#### TextureRootPath (path)
Working folder/directory of textures the areas will use.

#### Area
#### Texture (path)
The file path of the area's texture (background).
#### Gravity (float)
Gravity the area has; applies to items' velocities per tick.
#### Friction (float)
Friction of the area; applies to items' velocities when grounded or hitting walls.
### AirResistance (float)
Air resistance of the area; applies to items' velocities when airborne.

## character.xml
This is the main character file where much of the functionality is stored.

### Character
#### Name (string)
Name of the character; will appear in dialogue, stats, etc.
#### TextureRootPath (path)
Working folder/directory of where used textures will be contained within.
#### SoundRootPath (path)
Working folder/directory of where used sounds will be contained within.
#### Render (path)
Texture for the character's "render" (i.e., a typical full-body display), will show in the Select screen.
#### Portrait (path)
Texture for the character's "portrait" (i.e., a cropped profile view), will show in the Select screen.
#### Anm2 (path)
Character's "anm2" file (uses TextureRootPath); should have all the character's animations.
#### Description (string)
A general description of the character; will show in the Select screen.
#### Author (string)
The author of the character.
#### Weight (float, kilograms)
The character's starting weight, in kilograms.
#### Capacity (float, calories)
The character's starting capacity, in calories.
#### CapacityMin (float, calories)
The character's minimum capacity, in calories.
#### CapacityMax (float, calories)
The character's maximum capacity, in calories. Know that max capacity is determined by Capacity * CapacityMaxMultiplier; this determines the max of the "base" capacity.
#### CapacityMaxMultiplier (float)
Determines the effective max capacity; will be capacity times this number.
#### CapacityIfOverStuffedOnDigestBonus (float, percent)
When a character is over stuffed (i.e., over base capacity), the character will an additional capacity when digesting based on how overstuffed they are, based on how many calories over the base capacity.
#### CaloriesToKilogram (float)
Determines how many calories become a kilogram (1 cal -> X kg).
#### DigestionRate (float, percent/tick)
The base digestion rate, in percent per tick (60 ticks per second).
#### DigestionRateMin (float, percent/tick)
The minimum digestion rate for the character, in percent per tick.
#### DigestionRateMax (float, percent/tick)
The maximum digestion rate for the character, in percent per tick.
#### DigestionTimerMax (int, ticks)
When digesting, the digestion bar will count down, and then when it hits 0, the current calories will be digested. This determines how long this takes, in ticks.
#### EatSpeed (float)
A multiplier that speeds/slows down the eating animation, at base.
#### EatSpeedMin (float)
Determines the minimum eating speed multiplier.
#### EatSpeedMax (float)
Determines the maximum eating speed multiplier.
#### GurgleChance (float, percent)
Determines how often the character will gurgle (see the Gurgle sounds later) per tick. 
#### GurgleCapacityMultiplier (float)
Per the character's capacity, multiplies the character's gurgle chance based on the percent of capacity filled (based on max capacity). Higher capacity = higher gurgle chance, using this number at maximum.
#### DialoguePoolID (string)
Determines the character's base dialogue options (for the "How are you feeling?" option in Chat). This is effectively "Stage 1"'s dialogue; each stage should have its own dialogue pool (see later). Also see dialogue.xml for how "Pools" work.
### AlternateSpritesheet
Determines the alternate spritesheet of the character, if applicable (in Pokemon terms, the "shiny").
#### Texture (path)
The alternate spritesheet texture; uses TextureRootPath.
#### Sound (path)
The sound that will play when the spritesheet is set to alternate (either on new game, or with an item that has IsToggleSpritesheet; see items.xml); uses SoundRootPath.
#### ID (int)
ID of spritesheet that the alternate spritesheet will replace in the character's .anm2.
#### ChanceOnNewGame (float, percent)
Chance of rolling for the alternate spritesheet on starting a new game, in percent.
### Stages
A "stage" represents each visual change of the character as the weight increases. By default, there's always one stage; adding more here will add additional stages.
#### Threshold (float, kilograms)
The weight threshold to reach this stage, in kilograms.
#### DialoguePoolID (string)
Determines the stage's dialogue options (for the "How are you feeling?" option in Chat). Also see dialogue.xml for how "Pools" work.
### Animations
The character's animations. Know that a lot of character animations are typically easily played/activated through Dialogue; this is just for animations that aren't reliant on that system. Know that _these animations should just be the base name_; all animations are expected to have a stage number after them, so don't include the number for these.
### Start
The animation name that will first play when starting a new game; used for like a character's introduction.
### Idle
The idle animation that the character will regularly return to.
### IdleFull
When over capacity, this idle animation will be used instead.
### StageUp
When going to a new stage after digestion and going over a stage's threshold, this animation will play.
#### Animation
The name of the animation to be used for each of these.
### Overrides
"Overrides" are the term I use for when some animations will be tweaked by the game engine for effect (blinking and talking being the ones used). There are two elements; "Talk" and "Blink" for this. Typically, how this is handled is that each animation with have an invisible blinking/talking layer (just the graphic that blinks), which will change when called for. Again, review the .anm2 format for what a "layer" is. All that's sourced is just the spritesheet crop in these cases; so don't worry about how the blink/talk layers are set up.
### Override
#### LayerSource (string)
The layer in the animation which will be sourced for the override.
#### LayerDestination (string)
The layer in the animation which the source will be applied to.
### EatAreas
An "eat area" is where the food should be dragged to. I'm pretty much expecting this to only be a mouth for most characters but hey maybe you want the character to also eat through their butt or something. Again, not something that's well-developed at the moment.
### EatArea
#### Null (string)
The null area in the animation where food will be checked for. Again, review the .anm2 format.
#### Animation (string)
The animation that will play when food is dragged to it.
#### Event (string)
The event that will be checked for, detrermining the time the food is actually eaten/chewed. Again, review the .anm2 format.
### ExpandAreas
The areas which will expand based on capacity percent; usually a stomach. This adds additional scale onto the layer of an animation. This also can scale a null as well.
ExpandAreas are presently hardcoded to scale with both capacity and weight at a 50/50 ratio; this could be changed in the future for custom ratios.
#### ExpandArea
#### Layer (string)
The layer of the animation that will expand.
#### Null (string)
The null of the animation that will expand.
#### ScaleAdd (float, percent)
The scale that will be added at maximum. Know that scale is a percent; a {100, 100} scale is the default and is the normal scale of an animation.
### InteractAreas
The areas on a character which can be interacted with; usually for belly rubs, kisses, etc.
### InteractArea
#### Type ("Rub", "Kiss", "Smack")
Three types are presently hard-coded in, but this is kind of hacky and custom support for different interactions may later be added. The cursor will need to be set from the "Tools" in order for each interact area to be activated.
#### Null (string)
The null in which the interact area can be triggered. Again, review the .anm2 format.
#### Animation (string)
The animation that will play when the interact area is activated (hovering and clicking).
#### AnimationFull (string)
The above, but when character is full.
#### AnimationCursorHover (string)
The animation the cursor will play when hovering over the interact area. 
#### AnimationCursorActive (string)
The animation the cursor will play when holding down click over the interact area.
#### DialoguePoolID (string)
The dialogue pool which will be drawn from when activating an interact area (see dialogue.xml).
### Sound
An interact area can play multiple sounds when interacting; add additional Sound elements to achieve this. Don't worry about repeatedly-loaded sounds; the game will cache them beforehand for efficiency.
#### Path (path)
The path of the sound being used.
### Sounds
Sounds that play in some contexts.
### Digest
Sounds that will play when the character begins digesting (digestion bar full).
### Gurgle

#### Sound (path)
The path of the sound for the specific sound type.

## cursor.xml

### Return 
The cursor's return animation, when holding right click to return an item to the inventory (or to dispose of it if chewed.)
#### Animation (string)
The animation the cursor will use in these contexts.
### Sounds
Know that multiple of these sounds can be defined for each context.

# Conclusion

Hopefully this'll give you the resources you need to start making your own characters. If you need any help with this guide, or with clarification on anything, I'm available. Additionally, the game is [licensed as free software](https://github.com/ShweetsStuff/snivy), meaning if you're stuck the code should give you a clue (though I apologize for the lack of comments. Self-documenting code though, am I right? :^) )
